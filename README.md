# SoDocu - Software Documentation

With SoDocu you can document all requirements of your software directly beside
your code. The persistence is based on text files. So you can checkin and tag 
your requirements synchronously with your code in every kind of version control 
system. You can checkout your requirements at one point in time. So you know 
exactly what features are implemented at this time.

# Requirements need to be developed
Requirements are not fallen from th sky. They need to be developed. You can not
solve problems in code which are laying in incomplete or inconsistent 
requirements. Therefor you have to:
* discover requirement sources (like stakeholder or law documents) 
* investigate the system context
* identify containing business issues
* find targets for solving these issues
* describe scenarios to achieve the targets (user stories)
* strip down these scenarios in atomic requirements divided in data, function, 
state an quality

SoDocu itself is documented by SoDocu. So can see your first example directly
at folder "sodocu".
